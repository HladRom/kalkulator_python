- Title: Multiplication Table Generator

Description:
This program generates a multiplication table for a given number entered by the user. It prompts the user to input a number, then it iterates through the numbers from 1 to 10 and prints the multiplication table for the entered number.

Key Points:

Data Input: The user inputs a single number via the console.
Multiplication Table Generation: The program generates a multiplication table for the entered number by iterating from 1 to 10.
Computing Results: For each iteration, the program calculates the result of multiplying the entered number by the current iteration number.
Result Output: The program outputs each multiplication operation in the format: "number x iteration = result".
This code allows users to quickly generate multiplication tables for any given number, aiding in mathematical calculations and educational purposes.



- kalkulator1() :star:
  
  Description:
This code is a simple calculator written in the Python programming language. The user inputs numbers and the operation they want to perform (+, -, *, /), and the program calculates the result.

Key Points:

Data Input: The user inputs data via the console.
Data Processing: The user inputs two numbers (A and B) and an operation (C).
Performing Calculations: The program executes the chosen operation with the inputted numbers.
Result Output: The program outputs the result of the calculations.
Example Usage:

User inputs: A = 5, C = '+', B = 3
Program computes: Suma = 5 + 3 = 8
Program outputs: "Sum: 8"
This code demonstrates a simple yet effective way of creating a calculator using the Python programming language.
