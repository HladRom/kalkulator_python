- kalkulator3(function) :star: :star:

  This program is a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. It offers the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), inputs two numbers, and returns the result of the selected operation.

The program has the following interface:

Displays the text "Select an option:".
Presents options to choose the operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
The user selects an option by entering the corresponding number (1, 2, 3, or 4).
The user inputs two numbers.
The program calculates the result according to the selected operation.
If the user chooses the division operation, the program checks if the second number is not zero (to avoid division by zero error).
If the second number is zero, the program displays a message about the impossibility of division by zero and terminates execution.
If the entered operation choice is not valid (i.e., not 1, 2, 3, or 4), the program displays a message about the wrong choice and terminates execution.
After computing the result, the program displays it on the screen.
This program can be useful as an educational tool for learning basic programming principles or as part of a more complex system requiring calculations.

Title: Multiplication Table Generator

Description:
This program generates a multiplication table for a given number entered by the user. It prompts the user to input a number, then it iterates through the numbers from 1 to 10 and prints the multiplication table for the entered number.

Key Points:

Data Input: The user inputs a single number via the console.
Multiplication Table Generation: The program generates a multiplication table for the entered number by iterating from 1 to 10.
Computing Results: For each iteration, the program calculates the result of multiplying the entered number by the current iteration number.
Result Output: The program outputs each multiplication operation in the format: "number x iteration = result".
This code allows users to quickly generate multiplication tables for any given number, aiding in mathematical calculations and educational purposes.



- kalkulator1() :star:
  
Description:
This code is a simple calculator written in the Python programming language. The user inputs numbers and the operation they want to perform (+, -, *, /), and the program calculates the result.

Key Points:

Data Input: The user inputs data via the console.
Data Processing: The user inputs two numbers (A and B) and an operation (C).
Performing Calculations: The program executes the chosen operation with the inputted numbers.
Result Output: The program outputs the result of the calculations.
Example Usage:

User inputs: A = 5, C = '+', B = 3
Program computes: Suma = 5 + 3 = 8
Program outputs: "Sum: 8"
This code demonstrates a simple yet effective way of creating a calculator using the Python programming language.
