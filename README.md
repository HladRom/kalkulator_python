  Description:
This code is a simple calculator written in the Python programming language. The user inputs numbers and the operation they want to perform (+, -, *, /), and the program calculates the result.

Key Points:

Data Input: The user inputs data via the console.
Data Processing: The user inputs two numbers (A and B) and an operation (C).
Performing Calculations: The program executes the chosen operation with the inputted numbers.
Result Output: The program outputs the result of the calculations.
Example Usage:

User inputs: A = 5, C = '+', B = 3
Program computes: Suma = 5 + 3 = 8
Program outputs: "Sum: 8"
This code demonstrates a simple yet effective way of creating a calculator using the Python programming language.
